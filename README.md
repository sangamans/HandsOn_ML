# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron
This is my repository for solutions to exercises and examples found in the book above. I will update this repository as I make progress with the book.
This book is a great reosurce to get comfortable with Machine Learning concepts and even Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
I would recommend this book to anyone intrested in the field of data science!
